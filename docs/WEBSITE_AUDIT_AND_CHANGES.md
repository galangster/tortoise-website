# Tortoise Website Audit + Applied Changes (2026-02-23)

## What was hurting conversion

1. **Core differentiator was buried**
   - "Set race day and work backwards" was not consistently front-and-center.
2. **Pricing mismatch**
   - UI showed old values, creating trust risk.
3. **Message felt generic**
   - Copy sounded like many running apps instead of a clear category wedge.
4. **SEO intent depth was missing**
   - No dedicated pages for high-intent running queries.

## What was changed

### Positioning + copy
- Rewrote hero, CTA, and How It Works messaging around:
  - **Set race day → plan backwards with AI**
- Updated nav CTA text to reinforce the same action.

### Pricing
- Updated Pro pricing to:
  - **$7.99/month**
  - **$49.99/year**
- Added monthly/annual billing toggle for clarity.

### SEO + AI crawlability
- Added:
  - `/llms.txt`
  - `/llms-full.txt`
  - `/robots.txt`
  - `/sitemap.xml`
- Added `/solutions` plus 8 long-tail intent pages.
- Added metadata + JSON-LD enhancements.

### Delight + clarity
- Tightened headings and microcopy to feel more playful and goal-driven.
- Improved content flow from "why" → "how" → "pricing" → "action".
