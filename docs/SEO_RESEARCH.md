# SEO Research: Tortoise vs Top Running Apps

## Competitive landscape (observed repeatedly in review lists and community discussions)
- Strava (tracking + social)
- Nike Run Club (free guided coaching)
- Runna (structured coaching + personalization)
- MapMyRun / Couch to 5K variants (specific use-cases)

## Tortoise strategic wedge
Most top apps position around either:
1) tracking/community (Strava)
2) broad coaching content (NRC)
3) structured plans (Runna)

Tortoise should own this message:
**"Set race day. We build backward from it with an AI-native plan."**

That framing is clear, differentiated, and highly query-aligned.
